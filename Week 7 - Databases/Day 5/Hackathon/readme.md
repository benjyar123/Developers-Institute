'My Pathway' is a tool that might be used in a special needs education context to support teachers with designing and delivering personalised education programmes for their pupils.

This project provided a good opportunity to practice using forms with Flask. 
There are several forms on different pages that all interact with a simple database in a json file.

Next steps if I had more time would be:

- Include edit / delete options for all types of data
- Include some kind of login facility for different users with different permissions
- Make the design a little more pretty 
- Redesign with SQL Alchemy instead of json database
