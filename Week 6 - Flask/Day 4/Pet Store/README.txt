Notes for Mitchell or whoever might read this:

It's all starting to come together here and this project has been really helpful for increaasing my understanding, but I'm still confused about several things:

- The task suggested project structure which includes an __init__ file and routes but I just could not get it to work like that for some reason so I did it slightly differently

- There is loads of repetition in the main app.py file, mainly with json interactions. Need to find a way to reduce these.

- The task instructions also included that we should make classes and instantiate them but I couldn't understand why that would be helpful or how to do it.

- Is there a better way to handle the dumps to and from json?
